### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 14-year-old developer and founder of Nova Studios. Iâ€™m passionate about low-level programming, game engine development, and virtualization. Creator of Nova Engine, a C++ game engine built with Vulkan, focusing on 3D rendering, multiplayer functionality, and performance optimization. I also develop tools like Darker-Dark, a custom screen dimming utility, and manage Minecraft servers for a small gaming community. Always exploring new technologies like graphics programming, hardware, networking, and virtualization.
